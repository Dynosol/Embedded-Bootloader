# Secure Firmware Update System

## Project Overview
This project implements a secure bootloader and firmware update system designed to protect embedded systems against various security threats. The system includes mechanisms for firmware protection, secure updates, and bootloader verification. (This is an old project I'm leaving on my github to save for later---the readme is fully generated based on the codebase)

## Key Components

### Bootloader
- Secure boot process implementation
- Version control and verification
- Memory protection mechanisms
- Located in the `bootloader/` directory

### Firmware
- Main firmware implementation
- Custom linker scripts
- Library dependencies
- Located in the `firmware/` directory

### Tools
- `bl_build.py`: Script for building the bootloader
- `bl_emulate.py`: Emulation environment for testing
- `fw_protect.py`: Tool for protecting firmware images
- `fw_update.py`: Handles secure firmware update process

## Security Features
- Firmware integrity verification
- Version control to prevent rollback attacks
- Memory protection mechanisms
- Secure update protocol
- Protection against:
  - Rollback attacks
  - Invalid firmware installation
  - Intellectual property theft
  - Unauthorized memory access

## Building and Usage

### Prerequisites
- GCC toolchain
- Python 3.x
- Make

### Building the Bootloader
```bash
cd bootloader
make
```

### Building the Firmware
```bash
cd firmware
make
```

### Using the Tools
1. Protect firmware:
```bash
python tools/fw_protect.py [options]
```

2. Update firmware:
```bash
python tools/fw_update.py [options]
```

3. Emulate bootloader:
```bash
python tools/bl_emulate.py [options]
```

## Security Considerations
- Always verify firmware integrity before deployment
- Implement proper version control checks
- Protect against buffer overflow attacks
- Secure the release message handling
- Validate firmware size and frame order

## Contributing
Please ensure all security measures are properly implemented when contributing:
- Verify firmware integrity
- Implement version checking
- Add proper bounds checking
- Validate all input data
- Test against known attack vectors
